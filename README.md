# MovieSearch 

MovieSearch is a responsive single-page application that allows users to search for a movie by title, click to view the full information, and vote like or dislike. It built with JavaScript, React, Express, and Sequelize. Also, I used a movie database API from rapidapi.com to implement the search functionality.

## Setup : 
1. In your server, create a  ```'movie-search' ``` database.

CREATE DATABASE movie-search;
```

2. Download a package and its dependencies.

npm install 
```

3. Start the backend server in the  ```'server' ``` repository. 
 ```
 cd server  
 node app.js  
 ```

4. Start the application in the  ```'client' ``` repository.
 ```
