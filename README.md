# MovieSearch 

MovieSearch is a responsive single-page web application that allows users to search for a movie by title, click to view the full information, and vote like or dislike. It built with JavaScript, React, Express, and Sequelize. Also, I used a movie database API from rapidapi.com to implement the search functionality.
